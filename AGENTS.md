# Repository Guidelines

AWS Exams Prep Pro is a SwiftUI quiz companion with rewarded AdMob interstitials. Use this guide to keep contributions aligned with the shipped app.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `AWS Exams Prep Pro/` hosts SwiftUI entry points and feature views (`LandingView`, `HistoricalResultsView`, `QuizView`).
- `Quizzes/` inside the app target stores question JSON plus quiz models and loaders.
- Tests live in `AWS Exams Prep ProTests/` and `AWS Exams Prep ProUITests/`; `Assets.xcassets` and `Preview Content/` carry design assets.
- Managed code in `Pods/` is generated by CocoaPods—update `Podfile` and commit resulting lockfile changes instead.

## Build, Test & Development Commands
- `pod install` syncs `Google-Mobile-Ads-SDK` and regenerates the workspace.
- `open "AWS Exams Prep Pro.xcodeproj"` launches Xcode with the shared app scheme.
- `xcodebuild -scheme "AWS Exams Prep Pro" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' build` validates builds headlessly.
- `xcodebuild test -scheme "AWS Exams Prep Pro" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'` runs unit and UI tests.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 4-space indentation, group logic with `MARK:` comments, and keep SwiftUI modifiers on separate lines.
- Follow Swift API design: UpperCamelCase types, lowerCamelCase functions/properties, private helpers scoped with `private` or `fileprivate`.
- Preserve quiz JSON keys and asset names; new data files should match the existing lowercase-hyphen pattern.

## Testing Guidelines
- Add focused XCTest methods named `test<Scenario>` that cover scoring, attempt limits, and ad reward unlocking.
- Extend `AWS Exams Prep ProUITests` with flows that launch quizzes and assert confetti or limit messaging.
- Run `xcodebuild test` before pushing; aim for ≥80% coverage on new business logic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep commits short, sentence-case summaries (e.g. `Fix some answers in Cloud Practitioner`) mirroring current history.
- PRs should describe the change, list affected screens, attach simulator screenshots for UI updates, and mention Pod/Info.plist edits.
- Link related issues and record manual test notes so reviewers can re-run critical flows.

## AdMob & Configuration Tips
- Update `AdManager.swift` with environment-appropriate ad unit IDs and keep personal test IDs out of version control.
- Document new privacy strings in `AWS-Exams-Prep-Pro-Info.plist` and verify rewarded ads load on a clean simulator before merging.
